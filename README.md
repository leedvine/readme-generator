## Overview
A command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer).

The generated README.md file should have everything that a high-quality, professional README should contain.

The README is constructed by presenting the user with a list of questions with their unique answers automatically creating a README.md file ready for project use.
